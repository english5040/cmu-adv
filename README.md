    "That was some party last night... you must have had about twenty
    beers.  Or was it thirty?  As you try to recall, the night becomes
a giant blur, swimming around and around in your head.  It spins
faster, and you feel dizzy.  Don't worry, though, you're lying down.

Above are the first few lines of cmu.adv, a file which probably still exists on the CMU afs server. Apparently, a similar attempt at writing a CMU text adventure was made in 1986, in some arcane, lisp-like language.

This is a repository for the soon-to-be coolest text adventure on campus! *CMU-ADV* is written in TADS3, and compiles to a *.t3 format, readable by the [frob](https://github.com/realnc/frobtads "FrobTADS") interpreter.
